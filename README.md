# socket.io-connector

This package provides a simple and efficient way to set up a socket.io server and handle client connections and disconnections. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to customize the behavior of your socket.io server as needed.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install socket.io-connector
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the package:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const connector = require('socket.io-connector');

const server = http.createServer();

// Use the connector function to set up a socket.io server
const socket = connector(server, {
  // You can pass any socket.io options here
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `connector` function is used to set up a socket.io server on an HTTP server. The function takes two arguments: the server to attach to and an options object for socket.io.

## Testing

To run the tests for the package, use the following command:

```bash
